# Math377-NeuralNetwork
My own attempt at a LSTM to forecast future returns for 10 different assets from the S&amp;P 500 index. 
The future returns were used in conjunction with other group members' work to create a value at risk (VaR) simulation.
This demonstrates a curiousity for the intersection of data science, capital markets and risk management.
